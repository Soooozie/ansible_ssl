ansible-playbook provision-instance.yml

This repository is to provision and restore a website already configured with ssl. Preserves nginx, varnish, and wordpress ssl configurations. Generates new certificates when run. 

For provisioning, restoring and initial setup of ssl, please refer to my other repository just titled Ansible-Automation.

Feedback welcomed and appreciated. Thank you!
